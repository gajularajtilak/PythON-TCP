# PythON-TCP
TCP communication using Python script
1. First need to execute serverpy.py file as it is waiting for data to be recieved and then execute client1.py file.
2. I have prepended files with #! /usr/bin/env/python so first run command in terminal(chmod +x filename.py) and then execute it in terminal using (./filename.py) for linux.
